	Obs
	
Producer will capture video from select source, and run a back ground subtraction algorithm
Then each frame of the video will be posted to kafka
Consumer will get each frame and display on the browser.
The consumer could be a spark streaming job that counts people in images from thousands of video streams.
The producer could be made to send only frames that are different from the previous frame, to avoid still images.
